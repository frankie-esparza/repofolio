# 🎥 Repofolio
A library for auto-generating a dynamic portfolio from your Github, equipped with repo filtering, prioritization, & demo video properties. 

## Features 
Once you've created your portfolio website using the Repofolio library, you'll enjoy the following features: 
- 🪄 Your portfolio website will auto-update whenever you update a repo's name, description, homepage, or [topics](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics)
- ⏳ Viewers of your website will be able to easily filter repos to find what their interested in (e.g. show me all repos related to 'React')
- ⭐️ You can **highlight** and set the **priority** of repos so they always show up in a certain order on your page
- 🎥 You can optionally associate a **video** & **thumbnail** with each repo
- 🔧 You can optionally add **projects without repos** (e.g. you're not allowed to share the code or you had another career in a past life that wasn't software)

## Setup 
### Installation
1) PostgreSQL
- **For macs:** download the PostgreSQL app - [HERE](https://postgresapp.com/)
- **For non-macs:** download PostgresQL - [HERE]( https://www.postgresql.org/download/)  

2) Python 3.12.2 (or later) - [HERE](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

3) Pipenv ```pip install pipenv```    

4) Create a Virtual Environment (replace <<version_name>> with version of python you installed above) -  
```pipenv install --python "$PYENV_ROOT/versions/3.12.2/bin/python"```

5) Install all the dependencies for the Python App `npm install`

6) Create .env file 
```
FLASK_ENV=development
SECRET_KEY=<insert-secret-key-here>
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://repofolio:<insert-database-password-here>@localhost/repofolio
```    

7) Create .flaskenv file
```FLASK_APP=repofolio.py```    


### Run the App Locally
1) Create the PostgreSQL database:
cd into the 'repofolio' directory   
```psql```    
```DROP DATABASE repofolio;```    
```DROP USER repofolio;```    
```CREATE USER repofolio WITH PASSWORD '<insert-password-here>';```    
```CREATE DATABASE repofolio WITH OWNER repofolio;```    
you should see output showing that the thyme user & database were created

2) Seed the database: 
```\q``` to exist out of psql
```python database.py``` to seed the database 
```psql```
```SELECT * FROM repos;``` to confirm the data was seeded successfully 
```\q``` to exit out of psql

3) Start the server: 
```pipenv run flask run```
Then click on the link that says something like "Running on http://"...

4) If prompted to log into Github, follow the prompts
